            What to know before you play the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
            Kingdom! 05/17/2023
          </h3>
          <p>
            The wait is over—the Legend of Zelda™: Tears of the Kingdom game is
            finally here! There’s a lot to discover, and we want you to put your
            best boot forward when you set out in Hyrule. <br />
            Let’s start with a few important tips before you start playing. But
            don’t worry, we’ll stay away from any spoilers. Think of this
            article as a way to help get in the right mindset before playing.
            <br />
            Oh! And we’ll be bringing you more tips articles in the coming
            weeks, so be sure to keep an eye on the news feed.
          </p>

          <h3>Tip 1: Unlearn what you’ve learned</h3>
          <p>
            Yeah, this may sound like something you’d be told from a martial
            arts master, but hear us out. Whether you’ve played hundreds of
            hours of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or are brand new to
            the series, your experience level doesn’t really matter when it
            comes to this game. <br />
            While things you’ve done in previous games may still work, you have
            a wide variety of options in this sequel. Sure, you can still fight
            enemies with a stick … or you can fuse a boulder to your stick and
            jump on springboards to bonk enemies on the head. Sure, you can
            climb your way out of a hole … or you can use the Ascend ability to
            travel through the ceiling and get where you need to go.
          </p>

          <h3>Tip 2: Try everything</h3>
          <p>
            This game encourages you to try new things throughout. From
            traveling around Hyrule to solving puzzles, there are multiple ways
            to overcome problems you run into. The joy comes from trying out
            crazy ideas that end up working. <br />
            Oh, and if something isn’t working out the way you want, take a
            moment and try something else. Some players find joy in attempting a
            difficult jump over and over. Others would rather build a bridge.
            Experimentation is the heart of this game—even if a situation
            doesn’t go as expected, you may stumble upon something that will
            help you later.
          </p>

          <h3>Tip 3: Get some perspective</h3>
          <p>
            When you enter a new area, find a tall vantage point and scope out
            your surroundings. You’ll find all sorts of stuff—enemies, chests,
            materials, objects or terrain that will help in fights, and more.
            Believe us, it will be easier to do this before enemies spot you.
            Speaking of …
          </p>

          <h3>Tip 4: Prepare for fights beforehand</h3>
          <p>
            Look, you don’t have to do this—we’re (sometimes) fond of charging
            into the middle of things while screaming and wildly waving our arms
            too. But if you want to use the Fuse ability to make strong weapons
            or Ultrahand to build a makeshift missile turret, you may want to do
            that before Bokoblins are trying to smack you around. A little prep
            time can go a long way.
          </p>

          <h3>Tip 5: Use your words</h3>
          <p>
            This won’t work on enemies (at least the ones we’ve tried) but try
            talking to the more peaceful characters out there! In particular,
            characters called Constructs may give you helpful tips about the
            area.
          </p>

          <h3>Tip 6: Play it your way</h3>
          <p>
            OK, this is probably the most important tip. Sure, Link is the
            character in the game, but remember that you are the hero here. You
            are saving Hyrule. And you can do it how you want to! Play around
            with everything you get your hands on, because there’s room for
            massive creativity (and shenanigans) in this game. <br />
            With that said, don’t worry about not being “creative enough.”
            Everyone is creative on some level, and a part of creativity is
            giving yourself permission to try new things. We all play in
            different ways—messy ways, elaborate ways, unexpected ways, and
            silly ways that have no purpose other than to see what happens.
            Don't worry about playing the game “the right way” because it's up
            to you how you want to approach obstacles. If something works in the
            end, it’s a success. If it doesn’t, did you at least get a chuckle
            out of it?
          </p>

          <h3>Tip 7: Share the knowledge</h3>
          <p>
            And finally, creativity comes alive when you share what you know and
            get inspired by others. Talk to your friends to see what they’ve
            tried. Maybe find out what other people have done. You may be
            surprised what ends up inspiring you! <br />
            Alrighty, that’s all for now. Be on the lookout for our next tips
            article which will cover the four new abilities—Fuse, Ultrahand,
            Ascend, and Recall. You can also buy the game using the link below.
            <br />Have fun out there!
