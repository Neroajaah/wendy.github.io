        <h2>What is Zelda?</h2>
        <p>
          The Legend of Zelda is an action-adventure game franchise created by
          the Japanese game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It is
          primarily developed and published by Nintendo, although some portable
          installments and re-releases have been outsourced to Flagship,
          Vanpool, and Grezzo. The gameplay incorporates action-adventure and
          elements of action RPG games.
          <br /><br />

          The series centers on the various incarnations of Link, a courageous
          young man of the elf-like Hylian race, and Princess Zelda, a magical
          princess who is the mortal reincarnation of the goddess Hylia, as they
          fight to save the magical land of Hyrule from Ganon, an evil warlord
          turned demon king, who is the principal antagonist of the series.
          Ganon wishes to use the Triforce, a sacred relic left behind by the
          three goddesses that created Hyrule, to remake the world in his own
          dark image. When gathered together, the power of the Triforce can
          grant any wish its user desires; however, if someone with a heart that
          does not possess a balance of the three virtues of Power, Courage, and
          Wisdom attempts to touch the Triforce, it will split into three
          triangles and bond with three people whose hearts embody the required
          virtue.
          <br /><br />

          Although their personalities and backstory differ from game to game,
          the incarnations of Link and Zelda often have many traits in common,
          such as Link often being left-handed and clad in green, and Zelda
          being associated with wisdom, light, and prophesy. While the conflict
          with Ganon serves as a backbone for the series, some games have
          featured other settings and antagonists, with Link traveling or being
          sent to these other lands in their time of need.

        <h1>Gameplay</h1>
        <img src="gambar1/b4.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          The Legend of Zelda games feature a mix of puzzles, action,
          adventure/battle gameplay, and exploration. These elements have
          remained constant throughout the series, but with refinements and
          additions featured in each new game. Later games in the series also
          include stealth gameplay, where the player must avoid enemies while
          proceeding through a level, as well as racing elements. Although the
          games can be beaten with a minimal amount of exploration and side
          quests, the player is frequently rewarded with helpful items or
          increased abilities for solving puzzles or exploring hidden areas.
          Some items are consistent and appear many times throughout the series
          (such as bombs and bomb flowers, which can be used both as weapons and
          to open blocked or hidden doorways; boomerangs, which can kill or
          paralyze enemies; keys for locked doors; magic swords, shields, and
          bows and arrows), while others are unique to a single game. Though the
          games contain role-playing elements (Zelda II: The Adventure of Link
          is the only one to include an experience system), they emphasize
          straightforward hack-and-slash-style combat over the strategic,
          turn-based or active time combat of series like Final Fantasy. The
          game's role-playing elements, however, have led to much debate over
          whether or not the Zelda games should be classified as action
          role-playing games, a genre on which the series has had a strong
          influence. Miyamoto himself disagreed with the RPG label, but
          classified Zelda as "a real-time adventure game"; he said he was "not
          interested in systems where everything in the game is decided by stats
          and numbers" but what's "important to me is to preserve as much of
          that “live” feeling as possible" which he said "action games are
          better suited in conveying" to players.
          <br /><br />

          Every game in the main Zelda series has consisted of three principal
          areas: an overworld which connects all other areas, in which movement
          is multidirectional, allowing the player some degree of freedom of
          action; areas of interaction with other characters (merely caves or
          hidden rooms in the first game, but expanding to entire towns and
          cities in subsequent games) in which the player gains special items or
          advice, can purchase equipment or complete side quests; and dungeons,
          areas of labyrinthine layout, usually underground, comprising a wide
          range of difficult enemies, bosses, and items. Each dungeon usually
          has one major item inside, which can be essential for solving many of
          the puzzles within that dungeon and often plays a crucial role in
          defeating that dungeon's boss, as well as progressing through the
          game. In nearly every Zelda game, navigating a dungeon is aided by
          locating a map, which reveals its layout, and a magic compass, which
          reveals the location of significant and smaller items such as keys and
          equipment. In later games, the dungeon includes a special "big key"
          that will unlock the door to battle the dungeon's boss enemy and open
          the item chest.
          <br /><br />

          In most Zelda games, the player's HP or life meter is represented by a
          line of hearts, each heart typically representing two hit points. At
          the start of the game the player only has three hearts but players can
          increase their max hearts by finding heart-shaped crystals called
          "Heart Containers". Full heart containers are usually received at the
          end of dungeons and dropped by dungeon bosses. Smaller "Pieces of
          Heart" are awarded for completing side quests or found hidden around
          the game world in various places, and require a certain number
          (usually four) to form a full heart container. Health can be
          replenished by picking up hearts left by defeated enemies or destroyed
          objects, consuming items such as potions or food, or going to a Great
          Fairy Fountain to have the Great Fairy heal Link completely.
          Occasionally the player will find fairies hidden in specific
          locations; these fairies can either heal Link immediately or be kept
          in empty bottles, and will revive the player the next time they die.
          <br /><br />

          The games pioneered a number of features that were to become industry
          standards. The original Legend of Zelda was the first console game
          with a save function that enabled players to stop playing and then
          resume later. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time introduced a
          targeting system that let the player lock the camera on to enemy or
          friendly NPCs which simplified 3D combat.
