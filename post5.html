          <h3>
            Get to know Link’s four new abilities in The Legend of Zelda: Tears
            of the Kingdom
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our earlier tips article for the Legend of Zelda™: Tears of the
            Kingdom game had general advice for new players. Today’s article is
            all about Link’s four new abilities: Fuse, Ultrahand, Ascend, and
            Recall.
          </p>

          <h3>Fuse</h3>
          <h3>What is it?</h3>
          <p>
            Use this ability to fuse items to your equipped weapon and shield
            (even your arrows!). For example, say you have a chunk of amber in
            your inventory. Just drop it to the ground and use Fuse to augment
            your sword or shield. This may increase your equipment stats, but
            that’s just scratching the surface. Depending on what you fuse
            together, your creation may take on fun new properties!
          </p>

          <h3>What kind of properties?</h3>
          <p>
            For example, fusing your shield with a hunk of amber will make it
            stronger… but it also makes your shield into a weapon (due to it
            being all sharp and pointy now). Likewise, fuse Keese Eyeballs to
            your arrows to make them homing arrows. Try out any crazy combo that
            comes to mind!
          </p>

          <h3>Any special tips?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Don’t forget that you can fuse stuff to your equipment that’s
              already on the ground—you don’t have to put those items back in
              your inventory first.
            </li>
            <li>
              Monster horns are plentiful and can be solid additions to any
              weapon. Always keep a stash in your inventory.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t forget you can throw items in this game! It may be fun to
              fuse bomb arrows together, but you can also just throw the bomb
              flower instead.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Ultrahand</h3>
          <h3>What is it?</h3>
          <p>
            The Ultrahand ability allows you to pick up an object, rotate it,
            and then attach it to other objects. These objects include Zonai
            devices that add interesting effects—like rockets that that can give
            your vehicle a boost. <br />
            In this way, you can build all sorts of things. A boat with
            flamethrowers? Sure. Makeshift catapult? Why not?
          </p>

          <h3>Any special tips?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Controlling Ultrahand will take some practice at first. When you
              move something around, you’ll see where two items will attach (the
              attach point kind of looks like green glue). Pay attention to
              these attach points and you’ll be building elaborate creations in
              no time.
            </li>
            <li>
              If something didn’t attach correctly, highlight that specific part
              and gently wiggle your Right Stick to detach it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some Zonai devices turn on when you smack them with a weapon—just
              be careful to hit the device and not the rest of your creation.
              For example, swinging an axe around on a wooden boat is not the
              best idea.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Ascend</h3>
          <h3>What is it?</h3>
          <p>
            Use the Ascend ability to travel through ceilings and pop out the
            other side. Keep in mind that there are some limitations, such as
            the height of the ceiling above Link.
          </p>

          <h3>Any special tips?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When you’re exploring a cave, don’t forget about Ascend! It allows
              for a quick exit when things get hairy.
            </li>
            <li>
              While ascending, you can tap the B Button to cancel the process
              and drop back down. Just do this before you pop out the other
              side.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ascend can be fun to use in battle as well! Look for high vantage
              points that you can use to get the drop on enemies or escape their
              attacks.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Recall</h3>
          <h3>What is it?</h3>
          <p>
            Messing with the laws of time can be a good … time. Use Recall to
            rewind an object’s movement. The possibilities of this one may not
            be immediately apparent—so try using it on any object that moves to
            see what happens!
          </p>

          <h3>Any special tips?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use Recall to return projectiles to enemies that threw them at
              you. Talk about return to sender!
            </li>
            <li>
              Recall is very handy for resetting the positions of platforms or
              vehicles—such as a boat that’s drifting away without you on it.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can also Recall vehicles that you’re currently standing on. If
              your aircraft starts to veer to the right, reverse its movement to
              course correct.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That’s all for now—we hope these tips help you out! You can purchase
            the game at the link below.
